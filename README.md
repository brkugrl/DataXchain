# DataXchain
DataXchain is a website that allows users to sell their datasets to the potential buyers. It was coded in HTML and Node.js. While creating the website we used WordPress.com to create a template for our website and then we uploaded the HTML files which we got from WordPress.com to Cloud9 Amazon Web Service. In Cloud9 we used many different libraries such as bitcoinjs. In addition to those libraries, we used different API's which are called mongodb and REST API to make this website functional. We used mongodb to keep the user names and passwords because there is no option to keep the datas of the users in REST API. 
In the website, a user can be both seller and buyer. Sellers can add informations about their datasets. For example: what is that dataset about, dimension of the dataset, price of the dataset etc.. When a buyer search the name of the dataset, he/she can see informations about that particular dataset. If a buyer wants to buy that dataset, we ask the buyer to their bitcoin wallet address. If their wallet address is valid (we used bitcoin libraries to check the validity of wallets), website makes the transaction between the wallet of the buyer and the wallet of the seller by a specified amount of bitcoin. If the transaction is succesful, website sends the Google Drive link of that particular dataset to the buyer's e-mail address.
